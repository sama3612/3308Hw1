        <h1>Maddhi, Sai</h1>
        <p>I've been interested in computer science since eighth grade after completing my first internship. The work that I did at the internship was very inspirational and showed me how much I could accomplish with a knowledge of computer science. Three interesting facts about me: I go to India every 3 years, I snowboard, and I want to move to California after graduating.</p>
